# kinesis-to-s3

Application for copying Amazon Kinesis data to S3.

## Usage

1. [Download the app](https://github.com/codeflows/kinesis-to-s3/releases)
2. Configure your application (start with the template `KinesisToS3.SAMPLE.properties`)
3. Configure AWS access credentials:
    1. Locally, set either
        1. the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY=yyy`
        2. or the JVM options `-Daws.accessKeyId=xxx` and `-D=aws.secretKey=yyy`
    2. On Amazon EC2
        1. No configuration needed if you start the server instance with a proper IAM role (highly recommended!)
4. Run the app: `java -jar kinesis-to-s3-[version].jar configuration.properties`

## Development

The main class is `com.github.codeflows.aws.KinesisToS3`

### Building

Build with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). Running

    mvn clean package
will create a runnable jar at `./target/kinesis-to-s3-[version].jar`

## Notes

Licensed under the MIT license.

Uses the [Amazon Kinesis Client Library](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client),
the [Amazon Kinesis Connector Library](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-connectors)
and the [AWS SDK for Java](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java). These are also embedded in
the runnable jar. See [the AWS licensing terms](AMAZON_SOFTWARE_LICENSE.txt).

## Rationale

The [Kinesis Connector sample code](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-connectors/tree/master/src/main/samples)
contains code for copying Kinesis data to S3, but is not easily reusable. This application
contains the minimal code for the copying process and nothing else.
